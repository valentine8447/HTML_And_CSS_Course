        The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to
        do as part of their daily exercise routine.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Burpes</dt>
        <dd>
          Burpes are great, full body exercise to increase your strength and
          endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and
          extend your hands froward, kick your foot back and then forward
          again quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position.
        </dd>
        <dt>Plank</dt>
        <dd>
          Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push
          up position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position
          as long as you can.
        </dd>
        <dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
        <dd>
          Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on
          the floor in a push up position, then bring one knee up to your
          chest and then switch as quickly as you can (as though you are
          climbing a mountain).
